# Personal Task Tracker

## Description

This was a challenge offered by the University of Texas - Austin designed to give me a chance to practice Bootstrap and JQuery. The goal is simple:

Create a personal project tracker that keeps track of your projects by utilizing local storage and Moment.js to keep you motivated by changing colors based on the time of the day.

## How does it work

Open the website and you'll be greeted with a series of rows where you can input your notes and personal projects. When you are done entering the relevant information, click the submit button on the right side of the rows and voila! Your project info is saved for reference later.

As for the time tracking, grey means that time has passed, green is the future time and red means you are on that hour.
